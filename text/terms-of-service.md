3. ## Conclusion of Contract
The presentation of products in the online store does not constitute a legally binding offer but an invitation to place an order.
You can add products to the shopping cart without obligation. Before submitting the order, you can change the entered data at any time.
By clicking the order button, you place a binding order for the products in the shopping cart.
The purchase contract is concluded once we confirm your order via an order confirmation email.

Shipping costs are shown separately during the order process.
Available payment methods include:
Credit card
PayPal

Klarna (if available)

5. ## Shipping
Orders are shipped to the delivery address provided by you.
We ship within Germany only unless otherwise agreed upon.
Delivery time is typically 10 business days unless otherwise specified in the product listing.

6. ## Ownership
The goods remain our property until full payment is received.

7. ## Right of Withdrawal for Consumers
Right of Withdrawal:

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without providing any reason. The withdrawal period is 14 days from the date you or a third party, other than the carrier, take possession of the goods.

To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us (Faded Cloth, help@fadedcloth.de) of your decision by means of a clear statement (e.g., an email).

Consequences of Withdrawal:

If you withdraw from this contract, we will refund all payments received from you, excluding the shipping costs, within 14 days of receiving your withdrawal notification. Refunds will be issued using the same payment method you used for the original transaction, unless otherwise agreed.

8. ## Return Shipping Costs
In the case of a return, you bear the direct costs of returning the goods.

9. ## Warranty and Liability
You are entitled to statutory warranty rights for goods.
For defects in delivered goods, we are liable in accordance with statutory provisions unless otherwise stated below.
Claims for damages by the customer are excluded, except where the damage was caused intentionally or through gross negligence on our part or by our vicarious agents.

10. ## Dispute Resolution
The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR), which you can access at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" class="href">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>. We are not obligated and generally not willing to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.

11. ## Final Provisions
The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany apply, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
If any provision of these TOS is found to be invalid, the rest of the contract remains in effect.
